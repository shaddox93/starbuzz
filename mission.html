        <p>
        My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got
        everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway,
        I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>cell phone</li>
        <li>iPod</li>
        <li>digital camera</li>
        <li>and a protein bar</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
        Just the essentials. As
        Lao Tzu would have said, &#208;&epsilon;&tau;&#114;&ouml;&igrave;&tau;. <q>A journey of a
        thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
